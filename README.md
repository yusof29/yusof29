A dedicated and hard-working person seeking to obtain a career in front-end web development. Through my	 studies, I've gained a solid understanding of web development concepts and have dedicated a lot of my free time to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and applications. I am currently improving my skills and passionate about clean, minimal design that is easy to access and use. I am excited at the prospect of working alongside other excellent developers and taking my skills to the next level.
